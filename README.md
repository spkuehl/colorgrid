# Color Grid #

Expose Django URL to Create a Color Grid. I chose to send the data formatted to the frontend in an rgb(x,y,z) format.

Have a frontend display the colors in a square grid. With the ability to rotate the cells in a clockwise manner.

### TODO: ###
- [ ] Add more tests.
- [ ] Have the cells rotate in a clockwise manner.
- [ ] Create an alternate view to send unformatted 9 digit integers to the frontend.
